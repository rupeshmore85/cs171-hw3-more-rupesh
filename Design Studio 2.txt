PART 1 - ANALYSIS

Take a look at the population data. 

1. What trends do you see in the data?
- Data has negative years which needs to be filtered.
- Data has null values
- Data has to be trimmed from both the sides.
- Data is stored in the form of string which has commas which needs to be filtered and parsed to integers

2. Analyze how big the differences between various estimates are. 
Do you see a trend, i.e., do the differences become smaller or larger over time?

- By looking at the data, the large differences can be seen with the Population Reference Bureau's estimates.
Maybe it's because the population estimates data is projected for few years resulting in the huge percentage difference.
- The second huge difference seems to be with the Maddison's estimates. 
 
3. Think about these differences relative to the estimates at the respective time points and in absolute terms. 
When are the uncertainties the largest in absolute, when in relative terms?

- After calculating both the Relative and and Absolute differences for the consensus for 1995 (as we have values for all the 5 estimates), 
the average consensus sums up to 5,707,878,255.2
Below the table which shows the difference for the 5 estimates

              												Relative diff(In %)  Absolute diff
US Census Bureau:      								 		0.20				 11,201,516       
Population Reference Bureau:            					-0.91				 -52,121,745       
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs:   -0.09    			 -5,194,745       
HYDE:           											0.27				 15,523,718       
Maddison:       											0.54				 30,591,255       

4. Do you think you can faithfully represent the uncertainty and the data in the same plot? Why, or why not? 

- Yes we can plot it on the same graph. The uncertainty can be shown for a particular year for the estimates are available with a distinct color for each estimates.
The difference on the points on the y axis for different estimates can show the relative difference in the estimates.


5. What effect do you think will the linear interpolation have on the uncertainty?

- Linear interpolation it relatively soothes the large differences thus plotting on the graph is made possible.

6. Is linear interpolation a suitable method for this data?

- Yes linear interpolation is the best way to represent the values on the graph. It aligns the estimates properly on the graph within the range of the axes.
